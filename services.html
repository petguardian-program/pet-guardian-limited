      <h3>🐾 Real-Time & Normal GPS Tracking</h3>
      <p>
        Stay connected to your pet at all times. Our <strong>PawSentry</strong> device provides real-time location updates every few seconds, and normal tracking every 1–2 minutes to conserve battery. 
        See your pet’s position live on the app and even track multiple pets at once — each with unique colors and icons.

      <h3>🗺️ Geofencing Zones</h3>
      <p>
        Define <strong>safe zones</strong> (like your home) and <strong>danger zones</strong> (such as roads or restricted areas) through our app.  
        You’ll receive instant alerts whenever your pet leaves or enters these zones — ensuring you’re always one step ahead.

    <div class="feature">
      <h3>📶 WiFi Battery Saving</h3>
      <p>
        PawSentry intelligently switches to WiFi mode when your pet is home, reducing GPS usage and extending battery life.  
        It automatically returns to GPS mode once your pet leaves the WiFi range — no manual effort needed.
